Main function:

A while loop creates list of words. Loop continues until the next file == the original filename input
	Open each file, then read through the lines. Strip it down hopefully giving a word. 
	Check if there are any " " or "\t" in the line. If there are, there is more than one word, 
	so seperate the words by " " and "\t" and add to words to wordlist.
	If not, that means there is only a single word in the string, so add to the wordlist.
The complete list of words is then sorted by length.
Call to a second function using wordlist as the input. The program returns the result of this function call.

Second function:

Input is the list of words extracted from the .txt documents.

Primary for loop that loops through each position (eg 0 to 9 if the longest word has 10 chars).
	Secondary for loop loops through each word in the word list.
		If the word is too short (eg looking for the 4th letter of a 3 letter word), the loop breaks.
		If the word is long enough, a dictionary is used to keep track of the count of each letter.

	The max count in the dictionary of letters is recorded.
	A list is generated of letters which have a count == to the max count value. The "min" letter is taken (ie first choice a then b then c etc)
	The min letter is added to the output string
The function then returns the output string.
