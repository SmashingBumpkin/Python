# A lottery works as follows. Each participant pays in â‚¬5 and chooses six numbers in the range [1,90]. The
# total amount of collected money is shared among the winner(s). To determine the winner(s), 1 number in
# that range is drawn at random; all lottery participants who chose that number share equally in the
# winnings.
# Write a function lottery_winners(participants, x) that takes a dictionary (containing the participants names
# and numbers) and the value of the randomly drawn number x and that prints out the name of the winner(s)
# and the amount won by each.
# The dictionary containing the participants names and numbers is organised as in the following example:
# D = { "Donald" : [23, 21, 20, 34, 15, 23], "Boris" : [17, 16, 3, 7,
# 26, 42], "Theresa" : [13, 90, 47, 17, 1, 11] }
# As you can see, the numbers chosen by each participant are stored in a list. So, given the participant's
# name you can retrieve his/her numbers as follows:
# numbers = D["Boris"]
# As a consequence, numbers[0], numbers[1], etc. are the numbers played by "Boris".
# You may assume that participants' names are unique but their chosen numbers can (of course) repeat (i.e.
# different particpants could choose the same number or numbers).
# Test your function by writing a program and passing to your function the dictionary above and number
# 17. Since there are 3 participants and 2 of them ("Boris" and "Theresa") have chosen number 17, your
# function should print:
# Winners are: Boris, Theresa
# They win 7.5 euro each
