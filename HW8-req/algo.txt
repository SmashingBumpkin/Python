def dumbothello(filename : str) -> tuple[int,int,int] :

opens file and reads board to array
returns result from movechecker function

def move_checker(board, target, newcol)
	sets number of wins and ties to 0
	iterates through x and y in board looking for '.'
		copies the board to a new temporary board
		gets ranges for iteration (to ensure it doesn't seek a position outside the game board)
		iterates through surround spaces checking if the colour is the target colour
			Sets colour to be newcolour
			Keeps track that there was a legal move, so the result is valid
		If there was one legal move
			the move position is set to newcol
			the function calls itself with the temporary board, and switches target and newcol
			adds the result of the recursive call to the count for wins and ties.
	if there wasn't a single successful move, the winner of the current board is checked and added to the wins/ties
	the number of wins and ties is returned
		
All tests passed.
