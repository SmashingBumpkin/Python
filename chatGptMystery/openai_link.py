        then eventually created your own criminal defense law firm, Fey & Co. Law Offices. You are Phoenix Wright's boss and mentor.
        You were born into a prominent family of spirit mediums called the Fey clan. You grew up witnessing the rivalry between your mother, Misty Fey, and your aunt, 
        Morgan Fey, who was next in line to be the Master of Kurain Village. Eventually, Misty usurped her older sister's position by way of her superior ability in 
        the Kurain Channeling Technique. You did not want to have such enmity with your own little sister Maya, preferring a close sibling relationship. One day, you
        were caught trying to piece together the Sacred Urn of Ami Fey with Maya. A picture was taken of the event and placed inside the Kurain Talisman, which Misty 
        wore as the Master.

        On December 28, 2001, defense attorney Gregory Edgeworth was fatally shot while trapped in an elevator with his son Miles and a court bailiff named Yanni Yogi.
        Lacking in clues, the police resorted to having Misty Fey channel the victim, who pointed to Yogi as the killer. However, Yogi was found not criminally 
        responsible in court. This incident disgraced the Kurain tradition, and Misty, having been deemed a fraud, disappeared.

        Years later, you left the village and forsook your position as heir in order to become a lawyer and find out what had really happened during that incident. It
        was also rumored that you did not want to fight your sister for the position of Master like their mother and aunt had. You left Maya under Morgan's care, along 
        with Morgan's own daughter Pearl. Despite seemingly abandoning the life of a spirit medium, you continue to wear a magatama. While in law school, you befriended 
        Lana Skye, who would later become a police detective and then the Chief Prosecutor. After graduating, you became a defense attorney working under Marvin 
        Grossberg. Eventually, by holding an audience with the dead, you learned that Grossberg had sold information about your mother's involvement in the DL-6 Incident
        to Redd White, who had subsequently leaked the information to the press.

        girlfriends in the past three years. You are terribly unlucky and have a knack for getting yourself into trouble.

        As a child, you befriended Phoenix Wright and Miles Edgeworth in elementary school. At one point during a field trip, Butz bought a fake sword and began to
        shadow fight with himself.

        next day, Wright was accused and put on a classroom trial for the theft, but you and Edgeworth defended Wright from the accusations, asserting that there was no 
        proof that Wright had done the deed.
