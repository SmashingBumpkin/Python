def generate_snake:
	load in image and turn commands into a list
	Set the constants
		colours
		map size
		"command map" dictionary (containing the change in coordinates for each directional movement)
	Set the starting parameters
		Array containing all snake positions (initially 1)
		Snake head starting point
	Loop through list of commands
		Get next head X and Y positions based on the output of the command map
		Get next colour based on next head position
		Check if the move is legal:
			Check if next position is into an obstacle or into the snake
			If the move is diagonal, check if the snake is crossing itself
				End game, break the loop
		If the next color is NOT orange:
			Remove tail from the snake posn array, and turn the removed coordinates grey
		Set head x and y to be the next x and y
		Append next x and y to snake position array
	
	Save output image
	Return length of the snake position array
